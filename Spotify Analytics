For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. 
This data explores the Top 50 most listened to songs on Spotify in 2021.
Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );


1.	What was the most popular song of 2021 and who was the artist?

Select artist_name, popularity 
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC Limit 1;

2.	What was the least popular song of 2021, whop was the artist, what was the song, and what was it’s danceability?

Select artist_name, track_name, danceability, popularity 
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity ASC Limit 1;

3.	How many times does each artist appear in the “Top 50” list?

Select distinct artist_name, COUNT(track_ID)
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
Having COUNT(track_ID)>0
Order BY COUNT(track_ID) DESC;

4.	What is the total danceability of each artist from highest to lowest?

Select artist_name, SUM(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
Having SUM(danceability)>0
Order BY SUM(danceability) DESC;

5.	What song has the highest enery, and what is it’s tempo?

Select track_name, energy, tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER by energy DESC LIMIT 1;
