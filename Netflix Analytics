In this SQL code, I'm querying the database that has Netflix Data and answering questions regarding the data



** How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows) **

SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM “CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech”.”netflix_titles_info”
WHERE type=’Movie’;

** When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? **

SELECT max(date(date_added))
FROM “CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech”.”netflix_titles_info”;

** A list of all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order **

SELECT title
FROM “CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech”.”netflix_titles_info”
ORDER BY title ASC; 

** Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star? **

SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id=titles.show_id
WHERE titles.title=’Bright Star’;

** What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? **

SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type=’Movie’
ORDER BY release_year ASC
LIMIT 1;
