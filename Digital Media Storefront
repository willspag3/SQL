In this SQL, I used data from a digital media storefront that included tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

Select FirstName, LastName,CustomerId,Country
FROM chinook.customers 
Where Country <> 'USA';

**Only the customers from Brazil.

Select FirstName, LastName, Country
From customers
Where Country ='Brazil';

**Invoices of customers who are from Brazil.

Select a.FirstName, a.LastName, b.BillingCountry, b.InvoiceID, b.InvoiceDate
From customers a
Left Join invoices b
ON a.CustomerId=b.CustomerId
Where b.BillingCountry='Brazil';

**Employees who are Sales Agents.

Select EmployeeId, FirstName, LastName, Title 
From employees 
Where Title='Sales Support Agent';

**The invoices associated with each sales agent.
