SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

select count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
